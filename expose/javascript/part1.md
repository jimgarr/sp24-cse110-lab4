1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. Returns an error because we are trying to access a let variable that is declared inside a code block that line 13 is not a part of
5. Returns an error because line 5 declares a const variable 'result' and assigns it a value of 0. Then line 7 tries to reassign the value of result which is not allowed for const variables. The program then returns an error on line 7 and stops the execution of the rest of the code.
6. Same as above, the program returns an error on line 7 so line 13 doesn't get executed.
